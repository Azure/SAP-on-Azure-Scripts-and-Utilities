# Quality Check for SAP workloads on Azure

QualityCheck is an open-source tool to validate SAP on Azure installations. It connects to Azure Resource Manager and the operating system and validates the system configurations against Microsoft's best practise.
Running it regulary will always keep your system up to date.

QualityCheck supports SUSE, RedHat and Oracle Linux as well as HANA, Db2 and Oracle Database.

We are continouasly improving the tool and will add e.g. support for Windows and MSSQL in the near future.

> If you have additional ideas on what to check please open an issue.

When installing SAP on Azure please follow our guidelines available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/get-started).
Please pay close attention to the storage layout for HANA systems available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-vm-operations-storage).

The certified SAP HANA on Azure instances are available in the [Certified And Supported SAP HANA Hardware Directory](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/#/solutions?filters=iaas;ve:24)

Change Log is available [here](changelog.md)

## How does it work

Quality Check is a script that runs on Windows and Linux and connects to Azure and your SAP system.
It will query your system for required parameters and match it with Microsoft's best practice.

> There is no need to install any software on the SAP on Azure operating system.

> The commands are query only and don't change anything on the destination system.

## What's required on jumpbox

* PowerShell 7.2 or newer, you can download Powershell [here](https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=stable)
* Azure Az Powershell Module (Az.Compute, Az.Network, Az.NetAppFiles, Az.Account)
* Posh-SSH Module available through PowerShell Gallery, thanks to [darkoperator](https://github.com/darkoperator/Posh-SSH)

## Getting Started on jumpbox

A jumpbox could be a special VM to access your SAP system or your local machine, we'll just call ist jumpbox.

1. Install PowerShell 7.2
    * Windows

        To install Powershell on Windows use the link below, after installation search for "PowerShell 7" from the Start Menu

        [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows)

    * Linux

        Download PowerShell 7 using the link and installation guide below.

        [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux)

        After installing PowerShell start it using the command pwsh

        ```bash
        pwsh
        ```

        Due to license constraints Microsoft doesn't provide PowerShell for SUSE operating systems.

    * Mac

        Download and install PowerShell 7 on Mac using the link bwlow.

        [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-macos](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-macos)

2. After starting PowerShell you need to install the required PowerShell modules using:

    ```powershell
    Install-Module Az -Force
    Install-Module Az.NetAppFiles -Force
    Install-Module Posh-SSH -Force
    ```

    > Note that Install-Module Az -Force may take over 15 minutes to complete

3. Set the Execution Policy to unrestricted (we are working on signing the script)

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
    ```

4. Sign in to Azure Resource Manager using

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

5. Connect to the correct subscription (see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/servicemanagement/azure.service/select-azuresubscription?view=azuresmps-4.0.0) for details)

    ```powershell
    Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName 'your-subscription-name'
    ```

    OR

    ```powershell
    Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId 'your-subscription-id'
    ```

6. Download the script

    * Option 1: Clone the GitHub repo using

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Azure/SAP-on-Azure-Scripts-and-Utilities.git
        ```

    * Option 2: Download the required script files using wget or curl

        ```bash
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/SAP-on-Azure-Scripts-and-Utilities/main/QualityCheck/QualityCheck.ps1
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/SAP-on-Azure-Scripts-and-Utilities/main/QualityCheck/QualityCheck.json
        ```

    * Option 3: Download ZIP file from GitHub and extract it on your jumpbox

        You can directly download the latest ZIP file [here](https://github.com/Azure/SAP-on-Azure-Scripts-and-Utilities/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
